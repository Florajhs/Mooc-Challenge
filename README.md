# MOOC Challenge : Co2 calculator

**Theme :** 

Climate change

**My project :** 

Create an application using Java to address climate change. 
It is an application that will calculate the number of co2 emitted on a trip and according to the mode of transport chosen.

# Task

- [x] Collect c02 emitted by transport (plane, train, car, bicycle)
- [x] Create a main
- [x] Create 2 class with 4 functions
- [x] Create a loop function
- [ ] 

## Explain tasks

1. **Class main :** 
This class is the entry point for my program, and is the class name passed to the java interpreter command to run the application.
Loop (repeat a block of code)
Managing the end of the program : ask the user if he is finished. 
2. **Collect INPUT users :**
Asks the user to enter his journey in km.
Type of vehicle.  
What do I need ?
println, variable, variable type 
3. **Displays quantity of co2**
And by mode of transport
4. **Add emoji**

### Bonus
- [x] Display welcome message and explanatory text.

- [ ] Display a prevention message :"This journey emits a lot of co2" or "This route emits little co2" or "This trip does not emits c02. Bravo!"

- [ ] Propose a mode of transport that emits less co2 than the one chosen by the user.
